Hey, it's been a while huh? Welcome back to the physical world.
I'm the grim reaper, I'd come to take your soul a millenia ago, but you probably wouldn't remember that.
You probably have a lot of questions, and I'm not gonna bother answering them.
However..I guess im obligated to atleast give ya a briefing...
You were born and bred a warrior, fighting bravely alongside the Lords of Humanity against the Abyss.
Yet, your soul knows no rest, as you have been called once again by heretical forces to fight on humanity's behalf.
You're in the 'interstice', the place that exists at the edge of the living and the astral world...my duty extends only until you relearn what it is to be human, and depart for the world of the living.
